# Project Zootopia
## MAIN PROYECT

A nature reserve has asked us for a management system to control its fauna. They ask us, among other things:
They ask us, among other things:
- A main view with an access form to the administration area.
- Once logged in, the administrator must enter the dashboard.
- The system should allow:
    - Add a new specimen.
    - Delete a specimen.
    - Edit an specimen.

You should be able to view a list of items.

The list must have pagination. 

The specimens can be filtered according to the family to which it belongs or to the country of origin.

According to the requested requirements, we develop a flowchart that shows the options that the user will have when accessing our site.
### *Sketch*, *mockup* y *prototype*.

Using Figma we developed the **sketch**, **mockup** and **prototype** of what the web would look like to show who commissioned us and get their approval.

### VUE
Vue is installed to be able to access its module options, *stores*, *router* and other tools necessary to meet the requested requirements.
### HTML Estructure
Once the prototype was approved and **Vue** installed, the HTML structure necessary to develop the web was developed.
### SCSS
The web was customized so that it visually looks like the approved prototype.
### JavaScript
Through **JS** and **Vue**, we develop the necessary functions to meet the requested requirements:
- SPA (*Single Page Aplication*)
- Extern API access
- *Home Page*, *Dashboard*, *Main list*, *Modify view* and *Add view* section.
- In the *Main list view*, you will be able to delete and modify items.
- In addition, the possibility of being able to show the complete file of each element downloaded from the API is included.
